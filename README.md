# Visualization
code for visualization tasks

### What does it take sometimes
 In order to generate 3d movies, the codes will require the following:
     1. have a reserved allocation within the next 7 days on EDISON
     2. we need to run on 36,000 cores for 10 hours.
     3. Burlen has been running this as 15 - 1800 core jobs, but they run one after the other so it takes several days to finish.
     4. we also need 3-4 hours on interactive jobs.
     5. also, if there are best ways to break the big jobs up (or not at all), and how to run them without blocking interactive jobs, that would improve our productivity.
